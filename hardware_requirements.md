# Hardware Requirements for SkyTraces.xyz Setup

To set up SkyTraces.xyz on your own hardware, ensure you have the following components ready. These hardware requirements are optimized for deploying and running the platform on a Raspberry Pi.

## Required Components

### 1. Raspberry Pi (Latest Model)

- **Model**: Raspberry Pi 5 or newer.
- **Specifications**:
  - Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB or 16GB strongly recommended for advanced features).
  - Quad-core or higher ARM Cortex processor for enhanced computational power.
  - Support for USB 3.0 and dual HDMI output for multi-display setup.

### 2. MicroSD Card

- **Capacity**: At least 64GB (128GB or higher recommended for heavy data usage).
- **Class**: Class 10 or UHS-1 for optimal read/write speed.
- **Operating System**: Preload the card with the latest Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit version) or an equivalent lightweight Linux distribution.

### 3. Power Supply

- **Specification**: 5V, 3.5A USB-C power adapter with overcurrent protection.
- Ensure the power supply is official or certified to avoid performance issues and ensure stable operation under load.

### 4. Raspberry Pi Case

- **Type**: Durable case with advanced ventilation.
- **Additional Features**:
  - Built-in cooling fan or passive heatsink for thermal management.
  - Easy access to GPIO pins for expansion modules.
  - Shock-absorbing design for durability.

### 5. Network Connectivity

- **Option 1**: Ethernet cable for stable and high-speed wired connection.
- **Option 2**: Dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz/5GHz) for flexible wireless access.
- **Recommendation**: Use a gigabit Ethernet connection for optimal data transfer speeds.

### 6. Peripherals (Optional)

- **Keyboard and Mouse**: For initial setup and local management. Wireless peripherals can minimize cable clutter.
- **HDMI Cable and Monitor**: For direct access to the Raspberry Pi during setup. Ensure the monitor supports full HD or higher resolution.
- **USB Storage**: External USB 3.0 drive for expanding storage capacity.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Cooling Solutions**:

  - Attach a premium heatsink or use an active cooling fan case to maintain optimal operating temperature during intensive workloads.
  - Consider liquid cooling for sustained performance in high-demand scenarios.

- **Backup Power**:

  - Use a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to protect against power outages and ensure continuous operation.

- **Storage Expansion**:

  - Utilize an external SSD or NAS (Network-Attached Storage) for additional storage needs, especially if processing large datasets.

- **Module Extensions**:
  - Add compatible HATs (Hardware Attached on Top) for GPS tracking, environmental sensors, or extended I/O capabilities.
